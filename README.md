# Static-Data-Analyzer
Static code analysis performed early in the development before the testing begins. An automated loop was created and static tools on different codes were run. The studies showed that every tool had different metrics and they would perform different analysis based on Security, Exceptions and Warnings. 

The folder Static Analyze contains 2 folders and 2 files.

Test folder is the folder which has all the 15 codes which were given as input to all the static analyzer in different languages like Java,Python and C/C++.
These inputs codes were analysed and their errors and bugs were detected. 

Library folder is the project folder on which PMD(static data analyser) is run to detect the bugs and exceptions in the project.

pmd-report text file is the text file which contains all the bugs and warning associsted with Library project when PMD was run on it.

Project_Report is the word file that is the main file and contains detailed overview of what and how it is done in the Static Data Analyser project. It contains information on Static tools and also implementaiton of one of the tool on a project.The file contain various screenshots of the code and bugs.
